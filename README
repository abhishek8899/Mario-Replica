Mario Game description

Game runs by executing mario.py
It consists of 2 levels.

1st level:

Obstacles, enemies, background(stars), clouds are created randomly.
Enemies are not smart. They run in the till they collide with an obstacle.
You can collect points represented as 'O'.
Enemies can be killed bt jumping over them. If they collide with mario side by side, game gets over.

Once you reach the end of the 1st level, you will be asked to continue to the 2nd level where the boss is waiting.


2nd level:

Obstacles, enemies, background(stars), clouds are created randomly.
Enemies are smart. Some will chase you once you cross over them and some will show random motion.
Points can be collected in this level too.
Enemy can be killed as before.
Boss enemy is powerful and so a power-up in form of a gun is provided just before you face the boss.
Boss health is displayed simultaneously. Mario can kill the boss by hitting him three bullets.
For extra jump a spring is also there in front of the boss enemy, so that it becomes pretty easy to kill him.

Score is shown simultaneously where coins provide 50 points, killing enemy provides 100 points and killing boss provides 200 points.

Scenes change accordingly.

Different objects have been given different colours.

All features considering OOP, modular code, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, etc. are kept is care.
